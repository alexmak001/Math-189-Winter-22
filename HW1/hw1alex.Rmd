```{r cars2}

# Question 4
Blue is 4 cylinder, Purple is 6 cylinder, and Gray is 8 cylinder
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(x = d$wt,
     y = d$mpg,
     col = d$cyl,
     xlab = "Weight",
     ylab = "MPG",
     main = "Weight vs MGP VS # of Cylinders")
```

# Question 6

There is a relationship between wt and mpg and it is subject to the number of cylinders. As shown in the colored scatter plot, vehicles that weigh less and have 4 cylinders have the highest MPG. The second group is the 6 cylinder vehicles with medium weight and they have medium MPG. The last group is the heavy vehicles with the most cylinders and they have the lowest MPG.
